# Requirements

- Java 8 or newer
- System Tray support (Windows and some Linux desktop environments definitely support this)

# Features

- Show a toast message when your connection goes up or down
  - And, optionally, play a sound effect
- Log your connect/disconnect timestamps (currently no use for this unless you want to write some SQLite queries yourself)
- Start minimised
- Full and lite versions

# Versions
The two versions don't differ in functionality. The lite version installs only the tray icon without a JavaFX GUI and
thus will use less RAM.
